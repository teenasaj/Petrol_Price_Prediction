# Petrol_Price_Prediction
Project aims in predicting the petrol price for Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai based on historical daily data from 2018-2019.

The data consists of the daily price of petrol for two years in the four cities : Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai which was obtained from the official website of Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.

Prediction was done for the next 15 days using ARIMA and Holt Exponential Smoothing. Used Shiny package to build an interactive web application.

Out of the two models fitted for the four cities, we found that Holt Exponential Smoothing Model is more accurate compared to the other model.

Used Shiny package to build an interactive web application. The application built showed the data, details about the models fitted and also a comparison between the original price and predicted price.
